# Portfolio
Portfolio of my recent and not-so-recent work, consisting mainly of projects prepared for faculty courses.

There are currently three subfolders in this repository.
1) Minolovec - A project from when I first started coding and decided to code a classic game of minesweeper that you can play right in the terminal.
2) Tedenski projekti - Several selected weekly projects that were prepared for faculty courses. Since most of the coding is, due to the busy schedule and high tempo of faculty work, done in a time scramble, the code commonly isn't well commented or written with consideration for clarity for later revisions and is therefore not included in the portfolio. You can still glance over the reports that can provide some basic information about the project and what I've done. 
4) Seminarji - Folder containing some of the seminars that I prepared for a variety of faculty courses. Some are in form of slides, while others as classic seminars.
