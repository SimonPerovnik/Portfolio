# Portfolio
Portfolio of my recent and no so recent work.
Since I hadn't yet developed a habit of consistently uploading my projects to GitHub, this portfolio was assembled with some examples of my recent work and a fun example from when I first started learning how to code. 

There are currently five subfolders in this repository.
1) Začetki - A project from when I first started coding and decided to code a classic minesweeper that you can play right in the terminal.
2) Modelska analiza, PSUF, Višje računske metode - Several selected weekly projects that were prepared for faculty courses. Since most of the coding is, due to the busy schedule and high tempo of faculty work, done in a time scramble, the code commonly isn't well commented or written with consideration for clarity for later revisions, I haven't included any of the code. For now I would suggest glancing over the corresponding reports that can provide some basic information about the project. 
4) Seminars - Folder containing some of the seminars that I prepared for a variety of faculty courses.
