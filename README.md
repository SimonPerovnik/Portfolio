# Portfolio
Portfolio of my recent and no so recent work.
Since I hadn't yet developed a habit of consistently uploading my projects to GitHub, this portfolio was assembled with some examples of my recent work and a fun example from when I first started learning how to code. 

There are currently three subfolders in this repository.
1) Zaƒçetki - A project from when I first started programming and decided to program a classic minesweeper that you can play right in the terminal.
2) Modelska analiza - Several weekly projects that were prepared for a course in model analysis. Since most of the coding is, due to the busy schedule and high tempo of faculty work, done in a time scramble, the code commonly isn't well commented or written with consideration for clarity for later revisions. Perhaps I will add README files in the future and explain briefly how the scripts can be used. For now I would suggest glancing over the corresponding reports that can provide some basic information about the project. 
3) PSUF - Folder containing my work for a course in machine learning.
